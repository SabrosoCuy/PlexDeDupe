‚ö†Ô∏è Important: File Deletion Behavior
Files are moved to the Recycle Bin/Trash, NOT permanently deleted!

File deletion behavior depends on your Plex server settings:

If "Allow media deletion" is ENABLED in Plex (Default):
Removes entry from Plex database
Moves physical files to Recycle Bin (Windows) or Trash (Mac/Linux)
Files can be restored from Recycle Bin if needed
Disk space is freed after emptying Recycle Bin
If "Allow media deletion" is DISABLED in Plex:
Only removes entry from Plex database
Physical files remain untouched on disk
No disk space is freed
To check this setting:

Open Plex Web
Go to Settings ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Library
Click "Show Advanced"
Look for "Allow media deletion"
