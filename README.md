You can restore files if needed
Space is freed after emptying Recycle Bin

Network Drives (NAS, mapped drives, SMB shares):

Files are PERMANENTLY DELETED
NO Recycle Bin protection
Cannot be recovered
Be EXTRA careful with network storage!

Open Plex Web
Go to Settings ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Library
Click "Show Advanced"
Enable "Allow media deletion"
Save changes

Requirements:

"Allow media deletion" MUST be enabled in Plex settings
Without this setting, PlexDeDupe will fail with a 403 error

‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
Q: I'm getting a 403 error when trying to delete files
A: You need to enable "Allow media deletion" in Plex settings. Without this, PlexDeDupe cannot function.
Q: Will this permanently delete my files?
A:

Local drives: No! Files go to Recycle Bin/Trash
Network drives: YES! Files are permanently deleted immediately

Q: My media is on a NAS/network drive. Is it safe to use?
A: Be VERY careful! Network drives don't have a Recycle Bin. Files will be permanently deleted. Always use Dry Run first and have backups.
Q: How do I get my files back if I made a mistake?
A:

Local drives: Restore from Recycle Bin/Trash
Network drives: You can't - files are gone permanently (this is why backups are important)

Q: What if I want to free up space immediately?
A: After running PlexDeDupe on local drives, empty your Recycle Bin/Trash. For network drives, space is freed immediately.
Q: Can I preview what will be deleted?
A: Yes! Dry Run mode is enabled by default. It shows you exactly what would be deleted without actually doing anything.
